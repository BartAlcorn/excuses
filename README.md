# Excuses

I was mocking a monitoring system and needed to generate mock error messages.

Thus inspired by the classic "My dog ate my homework" and Start Trek's Technobabble "The EPS conduit phase shifted the warp core.", [Excuses](https://github.com/bartalcorn/excuses) was born.

```excuses.Pet()``` returns a "My dog ate my homework" style excuse (as a string),

while ```excuses.Tech()``` returns a technobabble sounding excuse (also as a string) in the format of "The HR department's network connection deallocated the senior management's warp core."

Yes, this is silly, but it serves it's purpose.
